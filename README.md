**DASmrrcoh**
======

## Description

**DASmrrcoh** package is used to store the reproducible and open-access scripts for denoising DAS data using MRR and enhancing earthquake detection by COHerency measure.

## NOTES:
 
1. To run the reproducible scripts (test_xxxx.m), please first download the required package from: https://github.com/chenyk1990/MATdrr. 

2. Please put the MATdrr package in the main directory and add its sub-directories to the Matlab toolbox path. 

3. The scripts beginning with "test_" are runnable scripts.

4. The script [test_processall.m](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly/tree/main/test_processall.m) is the script that generates all the results in the folders processed and figresults.

4. The directory [subroutines](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly/tree/main/subroutines) stores all the required subroutines. 

5. The directory [figresults](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly/tree/main/figresults) stores all the results from the proposed denoising workflow.

6. The directory [raw](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly/tree/main/raw) stores all the segmented multi-channel DAS seismic data at the SAFOD site. 

7. The directory [processed](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly/tree/main/processed) stores all the denoised DAS data. 

8. The current version is based on Matlab. Future versions will also support Python and be optimized regarding computational efficiency. 

9. All datasets used in these DEMO scripts or produced from massive processing based on this package are in a separate repository https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly (for easier downloading). 

10. The difference between the two "similar repositories" [dasmrrcoh](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh) and [dasmrrcoh-dataonly](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly) is that the latter is only used for storing the data (several GBs) and the former is only used for storing the scripts (less than 1 MB). 

11. All figures (except for fig1, which is a schematic plot) in the DASmrrcoh paper are in the following directory for a quick look (https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly/tree/main/gallery/).

## Gallery
The gallery figures of the DASmrrcoh package can be found at
    https://github.com/chenyk1990/dasmrrcoh-dataonly/tree/main/gallery/
Each figure in the gallery directory corresponds to a test_figNO.m script in the "main" directory with the exactly the same file name (figNO.png).

These gallery figures are also presented below.
